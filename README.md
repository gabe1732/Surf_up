Module = 9 Challenge

## Overview of Surfs up startup  
The purpose of this week's analysis was to help determine the sustainablity of a Surf shop that provides both Surfing and ice cream to their customers.  Using weather data we wanted to find out if it would be warm enough year around to be able to serve the customers ice cream.   
 

## Results 
Looking at probably the two most extreme months of the year June and December we were able to determine that the difference in avearge tempatures is only about four degrees.

- With temptures in the 70's for both months it would seem that ice cream would be still a viable product to sell through out the year.  

 
## Summary 
In conclusion it looks like a Surf shop that sells ice cream to supplement their revenue seems like a good long term investment.  In looking at the data even if the tempatures were to drop dramtically they should be able to quickly change products and sale hot choclate in the cold months if that were to happen.  One data point that I wished was added was water temp and wave data.  To see if people would be surfing in that area as well.
